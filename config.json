Enhance chest, shoulders, and arms proportionally. Maintain natural skin texture, lighting, and realistic anatomy. Remove any excess body fat while keeping a healthy, achievable look.

Enhance chest muscles, defined shoulders, toned arms, and visible obliques. Add natural vascularity and muscle separation. Maintain realistic proportions and natural lighting. Professional athlete body composition with 12-15% body fat appearance."

      "prompt": "Transform the entire body into a highly defined, muscular physique. Create prominent six-pack abs with deep cuts and strong definition. Add muscular chest, broad shoulders, defined arms with visible veins, and sculpted obliques. Show clear muscle separation and low body fat (8-10%). Maintain natural skin texture and professional bodybuilding photography quality. Peak athletic condition."

      "description": "Endurance athlete transformation",
      "prompt": "Transform the subject to look like they have trained consistently for six months of distance running: Slightly leaner full-body composition with reduced body fat, especially around the waist and hips. Visible yet subtle calf definition, toned quadriceps, and a slightly lifted glute line from repetitive stride work. Posture aligns with runners—relaxed shoulders, elongated neck, confident stance. Preserve natural skin texture and match the original lighting. Outfit should follow original clothing but may appear slightly better fitting due to leaner frame. Maintain the subject’s identity and overall aesthetic."

      "description": "Functional lean muscle",
      "prompt": "Transform this person to reflect six months of dedicated indoor/outdoor climbing: Stronger forearms with visible tendon definition, broader upper back with pronounced lats, and improved shoulder stability. Emphasize functional, wiry muscle mass rather than bulky size. Slight chalk dust hints on hands/forearms are acceptable if they fit the scene. Keep abs natural but show oblique engagement from twisting climbs. Skin texture, lighting, clothing, and environment must remain realistic and consistent with the original photo."

      "prompt": "Depict a realistic transformation after six months of consistent strength training in the gym: noticeable chest volume, fuller deltoids, defined but attainable abdominal tone, and slightly increased arm thickness. Maintain proportional development across upper and lower body—no cartoonish bulk. Preserve the subject’s face, skin texture, lighting, and wardrobe. The result should feel like a dedicated gym-goer with visible progress, not a professional bodybuilder."
